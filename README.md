I wrote this app, when I was working as a freelancer while still in college. The idea was never taken forward. But the initial prototype still remains.

Please consider the following before using the app.
1. The app was written 4 years ago by a rookie(me), and is therefore not written with best practices and efficiency in mind.

2. It hasnt been tested on a lot of devices, but on the ones it has been tested, it has done well.

3. To use the map feature, include your Google Maps API key in the manifest. The place is marked with "place your api key here".

4. An apk is included, but it does not include an API key, so the Maps feature will not work on it.

You can use the app and the code, in any way you like. Have fun!
